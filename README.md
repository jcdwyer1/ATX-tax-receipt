[ copied from project proposal - more detail coming soon! ]

## Short description of the idea (140 character tweet):

A website that provides Austinites with a customized property tax receipt showing how their money is spent by the city. 

## What is your project concept or idea? What challenge or opportunity will it solve?

Next to mobility, affordability is arguably the hottest topic facing our growing city. Affordability can mean many things, but often the debate focuses on the size and purposes of our City budget.

Whether you rent or own in Austin, you are paying property taxes to fund City services. Yet the uses of your money are buried under confusing names in [700-page](https://assets.austintexas.gov/budget/15-16/downloads/Vol1Approved_Final.pdf) budget documents, making it hard to develop an informed opinion that can contribute to the public debate. 

How much do you pay in property taxes? Is it a reasonable amount? What purposes does your money serve? Are these costs going up or down?

A simple, well-designed tax receipt (similar to the one [created by the White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/2014-taxreceipt)) can help answer these questions. 
 
## Who will benefit from your project? Describe the humans at the center of the problem - who are they?

Nearly every Austin resident is a property taxpayer. Most Austin residents are feeling the squeeze of our rising cost of living. It's easy to point fingers towards City Hall, but very few Austinites have a good understanding of how our tax dollars are really put to work.

Users of this website will benefit from a greater understanding of how much their property taxes contribute to their overall housing costs, what those taxes pay for, and how much of their tax bill goes to which City services. 

Ideally the site will also give users the opportunity to share their new knowledge via social media, or act on it by contacting their City Council Member. 

## Issue area(s) relevant to your project idea: 

- Affordability
- Economic Development
- Economic Opportunity
- Open Government/Transparency

## What is the current state of your project idea?
- I have an idea or **concept** of a solution, but have not yet prototyped or tested it

## Tell us more about the current state of your project idea.

There are two public datasets that need to married by this website in order to provide a customized result:

1. The overall property taxes paid by each Austin address are [public and searchable](https://tax-office.traviscountytx.gov/properties/account-search). However, that data is in pdf form, and hard to parse if you don't know what you're looking at ([here's mine, for example](https://travis.go2gov.net/export?type=org&account=04142702580000)).To be successful, this project will need to figure out a way to use Travis County's property tax search essentially as a GIS service - users would input their address to our website, and our backend would query the Travis County website and extract/return the right number from the resulting pdf. Challenging! Maybe there's another way?
2. The share of each tax dollar funding various City services is detailed in the City of Austin's [annual budget documents](https://assets.austintexas.gov/budget/15-16/downloads/Vol1Approved_Final.pdf). However, that information is hard to find, and not formatted or phrased in a way that is helpful to the average Austinite. To be successful, we will need to extract the top-line spending categories from this document, divide them by the total City budget (general revenue) and use the resulting fractions as multipliers that will be applied to the resulting number from (1) above. I've already been working on this part, and expect to have it ready to go by June 3.

The resulting numbers generated by our website will show the exact amount that the property taxpayer contributed to each spending category. These numbers will then need to be graphically or textually presented in a way that is compelling and easy to understand. 

Ideally the page will also include functions for the user to share their result on social media (such as by share buttons) or take action by contacting their City Council Member. 

## Tell us about yourself. 

I participated in both previous ATX Hack for Change events as a project champion, and have a good idea of the right kind of scope & team skills needed for a fulfilling weekend project. 

In my day-job, I work for [Feeding Texas](http://www.feedingtexas.org), a statewide nonprofit leading a unified effort for a hunger-free Texas. In the last two hackathons I championed projects related to my work, both of which evolved into core functions of our website - our [SNAPshot data tool ](http://www.feedingtexas.org/learn/communities/snapshot-texas/)and [Texas Advocacy app](http://stage.feedingtexas.org/get-involved/advocate/) (currently undergoing maintenance). 

In my night-life, I help organize a free monthly barroom lecture series called [Nerd Nite](https://www.facebook.com/groups/338681696297530/). This means I'm good at talking about nerdy stuff (like web technology) without actually having much depth to my knowledge :)

This year, the project is a personal one. Based on the subject, you might think that I am anti-tax or anti-government, but I am actually quite the opposite. I think that most users of this proposed website will learn how *little* they actually pay towards City services, and how the relative share consumed by various City services is probably not what they expected. I'm hoping that this website will help our city *avoid* knee-jerk, anti-tax conversations once taxpayers are presented with information that is actually accurate and relevant to their lives.
